These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and natural language understanding. AI systems achieve this through various techniques, such as machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing, enabling them to analyze data, identify patterns, and make predictions or decisions.  The goal of AI is to create intelligent agents that can interact with the world and solve complex problems autonomously.
